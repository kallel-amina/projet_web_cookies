        <h1><i>The Story Behind Sweet Bites</i></h1>

        <p>
            Sweet Bites was born from a simple belief: <br>
            <strong>the best desserts aren’t rushed they’re felt.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            It started in a small kitchen, with flour-dusted counters, the smell of melted chocolate,
            and late nights driven by pure love for baking. Every recipe was tested, failed,
            perfected, and tested again not to impress, but to make people smile.
        </p>

        <p>
            We didn’t want to create just another dessert brand.
            We wanted to create moments.
        </p>

        <p>
            A tiramisu that feels like comfort after a long day.<br>
            A brownie that melts slowly, reminding you to pause.<br>
            A cookie that tastes homemade because it truly is.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Sweet Bites, everything is handmade, in small batches, using carefully selected
            ingredients and a lot of patience. No shortcuts. No mass production. Just real flavors,
            real textures, and real passion in every bite.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each dessert tells a story of care, warmth, and attention, because we believe sweetness
            is not just a taste, it’s an experience.
        </p>

        <p class="highlight">
            Sweet Bites isn’t about selling desserts. <br>
            It’s about sharing joy, one bite at a time. 🤍
